	%-The response data is stored in XML files
	%-The survey engine runs C++.
	%-Rules are defined in \gls{xsd}.
	%-Number and type of arguments cannot be validated when the questionnaire specification file is read. Argument validation must wait until the function is actually invoked.
	%-Expressions are evaluated recursively from inside out.
	%-Functional approach leds to expressive structurefor representing calculations and expressions

	%\gls{sss}, known as a \gls{capi} system solution developed for \gls{rti} which has its own \gls{xml} specification language to address the questionnaire constructs \cite{art:bethke08}.
	%This language has a different approach to define its logical and arithmetical expressions based on a functional programming style which makes the authoring language more robust and less prone errors.
	\gls{sss} is a \gls{capi} system solution developed for \gls{rti} which has its own \gls{xml} language to address content, routing and personalisation features of surveys \cite{art:bethke08}. This language unlike \gls{triples}, \gls{qdl} or \gls{ddi} has a robust schema to represent the logical and arithmetical expressions based on functional programming style.
