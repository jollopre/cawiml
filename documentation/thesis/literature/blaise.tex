	-Blaise is a programming language to specify questionnaires.
	-The content features known as \emph{fields} allow defining the different type of questions.
	-The routing known as \emph{rules} determine the flow through the questionnaire.
	-A block (defined one and reused several times) represent a section or sub-section of a questionnaire which groups fields and their rules associated.
	-Piping for question text substitution is supported but they are time consuming to set up and test. Although this can result helpful for the interviewers it adds extra task for the questionnnaire's programmers.
	-Language capabilities which allow interviewers to switch between spoken languages.
	-Blaise only implement filter known as gate imposing the need of translating any skip statements defined over paper questionnaire.
	-The designers should state the flow in terms of if conditions. The use of flow chart might aid them in that translation.
