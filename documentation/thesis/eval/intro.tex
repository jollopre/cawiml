	In this Chapter we have conducted experiments at two levels. Firstly, we have encoded fifteen real questionnaires into \gls{cawiml} in order to determine the coverage of constructs provided. And secondly, we have performed stress testing of our state-transition for conducting interviews by simulating a scenario that is executed with increasing loads.

	The rest of this Chapter is structured as follows: Section \ref{sec:eval:xmlEvaluation} provides the frequencies for questionnaire's features in our \gls{xml} solution and analyses the results obtained. Section \ref{sec:eval:collectionStageEvaluation} introduces the methodology adopted for determining system's capacity. In this procedure parameters such as number of interviewees connected or metrics like response times have been considered in order to analyse results for interviews with simulated data.
