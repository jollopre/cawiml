	The \gls{xml} solution that we have designed has been evaluated against several real questionnaires provided by third parties to Pexel. These paper questionnaires remain under the company premises and cannot be disclosed. In the Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:questionnaires}, we have provided links to these real questionnaires implemented in our authoring language, however, we have replaced and eliminated any sensitive information in order to anonymise the third parties behind each survey. In respect to the survey used to explain the different features that a questionnaire may have (see Figure \ref{fig:background:survey}), this instance constitutes a simulated paper questionnaire and consequently does not contain any confidential information from any third party.

	The evaluation of our new \gls{cawi} architecture for the gathering of responses for questionnaires presented in Chapter \ref{ch:evaluation} has used randomly generated data, thus having no ethical implications. Other experiments that have been conducted during the course of this on-line survey solution such as usability testing in which the system was evaluated by Pexel's employees, may contain personal details or handling of commercially sensitive information but these are adequately described by \gls{iso} 20252 with which the company complies.
