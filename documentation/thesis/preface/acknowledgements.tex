	Firstly, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Dr. Nirmalie Wiratunga for the continuous support of my MRes study and related research, for her patience, motivation, and immense knowledge. Her guidance has helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis.

	Besides my supervisor, I would like to thank Pexel Research Services and Robert Gordon University for giving me the opportunity to undertake a \gls{ktp} project with the possibility to study for a postgraduate qualification. In particular, I am grateful to Bruce Leslie for his insightful comments and expertise at every stage of this research, but also for his task of selecting and testing the real-world survey samples through my experiments.

	On a more personal level, I must thank my patient and understanding girlfriend Daria for all her love and support. She has not only accepted me on all my bad days but also has encouraged me many times to put all my best for this research. I have also to mention perhaps the most faithful companion, my dog Hugo, for all the days and nights that he has been sat next to me.

	Last but not least, I thank my family, and in particular my mum, who has been always proud of all the efforts I have made in order to look for better career opportunities.
