	This Chapter introduces our \gls{cawi} system based on \gls{rest} architectural constraints to support survey life-cycle through the specification of questionnaires using \gls{cawiml}. We have proposed a multi-layer architecture that uses \gls{xml} and \gls{json} for client server communication. In this infrastructure, the client and server implementations are separated, so changes made at any side do not impact negatively into the other which helps them to evolve independently. The client side, which adopts the novel \gls{spa} paradigm to build the \gls{html} code directly in the browser through JavaScript, has reduced the server burden and consequently improved responsiveness.

	The rest of this Chapter is structured as follows: The system architecture is presented in Section \ref{sec:cawiSystem:architecture} where its different layers are explained. Thereafter Section \ref{sec:cawiSystem:implementation} provides implementation details for server and client respectively.
