	The server side of our \gls{cawi} system is separated into three layers, i.e. \gls{rest}ful \gls{api}, business layer and data access layer. Section \ref{sec:cawiSystem:restfulImplementation} explains the implementation of \gls{rest} principles through an example that overviews the \gls{http} methods utilised for the collection stage. Regarding the state-transition used for gathering survey data, we have focused on explaining the \gls{rpn} algorithm that evaluates expressions for routing and personalisation constructs on real-time in Section \ref{sec:cawiSystem:rpnEvaluation}.
