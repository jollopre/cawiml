	Our \gls{cawi} system solution for survey life-cycle adopts \gls{rest} constraints to adhere to scalability, simplicity and reliability architectural properties expected for \gls{cawi} systems. Particularly, the \gls{rest} \gls{api}, which conforms to the \gls{http} protocol, has been implemented with the standard reference library for Java. This multi-layered solution is highly portable and uses a \gls{nosql} database solution which permits a more flexible persistence solution when compared to the traditional relational databases.

	The client side, based on the \gls{spa} not only improves the responsiveness of a distributed system but also helps to produce richer interactive interfaces. This paradigm when compared to the multi-page approach that \gls{cawi} systems such as Blaise or SurveyMokey adopt, is more attractive. Particularly, with the choice of AngularJS as the framework for building pages, we have gained a simplified cross browser testing of functionalities, reduced the server burden by transferring interface logics to the client and promoted a parallel development of design and collection interfaces.
