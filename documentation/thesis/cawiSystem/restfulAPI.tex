	The process of conducting survey research is separated into five stages (see Section \ref{sec:literature:surveyStages}). In order to address these separated steps, we have implemented a \gls{rest} \gls{api} that permits client communication between these five services (e.g. design, collection, management, analysis and reporting). The business objects, represented as Java classes, are converted to \gls{json} or \gls{xml} every time the server responds to a request through a process named \emph{marshalling}. Similarly, when data sent from client is received, an \emph{unmarshalling} process transforms it to the adequate business object class instance.

	The design service, seen as the only stage that uses \gls{xml} exchange format to communicate the parts, deals with the definition of questionnaire instances according to \gls{cawiml}. The rest of the services, only accept \gls{json} because it offers a direct mapping to JavaScript objects in which our client interfaces are built and also it is less verbose than \gls{xml} which helps to reduce the amount of data transferred across client and server.

	The collection service uses GET, POST and DELETE \gls{http} verbs to produce uniform interfaces for communication. The GET provides services for retrieving general information of any survey (e.g. title, description or date they were created) or to fetch incomplete interviews either because the interviewer decided to postpone or because the browser was closed. The POST verb is used for actions such as starting an interview or to store questionnaire responses when moving forward and backward through a survey. The DELETE is used throughout this service for activities like marking the ending of an interview, i.e. to remove the possibility of a valid client token to modify a questionnaire that is completed.

	%The management, analysis and reporting services we have decided to implement one interface that captures all of the requirements, firstly because we still do not have enough features to clearly separate them and secondly because these stages are interdependent.
